# JavaScript
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

My Class Summary
* Comments

Single line comments start with //.

Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).


* Data Types

String	represents textual data	'hello' , "hello world!" etc
Number	an integer or a floating-point number	3 , 3.234 , 3e-2 etc.
Boolean	Any of two values: true or false	true and false

* Variables

x=0 y=8
var username ="Basel"
var myid = 123
var test = true

* How can we see the value
Example
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
From the example above, you can expect:

x stores the value 5
y stores the value 6
z stores the value 11

* Operations

Addition +

Subtraction -

Multiplication *

Exponentiation **

Division /

Modulus (Remainder) %

Increment ++

Decrement --

* Conditional Statments 

JavaScript if else and else if
Conditional Statements
Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed


if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}

Example
Make a "Good day" greeting if the hour is less than 18:00:

if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
}
The result of greeting will be:

Good day
