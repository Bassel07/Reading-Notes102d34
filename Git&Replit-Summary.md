### “We can Fork it before we make any changes to the code.”

Huh?

The obscure sentence was one of several the two developers exchanged as we were going through a development proposal for a new client.

By the end of the session, it felt as if I had the means to compile an entire dictionary of new words, technical references and jargon - most of which I wouldn’t have been able to understand if we were having this meeting several months prior.

Look, if you’ve frequented the tech scene a bit, or have spent some time in the presence of web developers, it’s likely that you may have heard of “Git”, “GitHub” or “BitBucket” at some stage during a conversation. You may have even come across the adorable GitHub logo of an octopus crossed with a kitten floating around the internet.

## Introduction to Replit
### Replit is a coding platform that lets you write code and host apps. It also has many educational features built-in, making it great for teachers and learners too.

You can use Replit in different ways. It can replace some or all of your:

Code editors (e.g. VS Code, Sublime Text, IntelliJ)
Development environments (e.g. your operating system, and build tools like npm or pip)
Cloud providers (e.g. AWS, Netlify)
Team collaboration tools (e.g. Google Docs, GitHub)
Teaching tools (e.g. Canva, Moodle, Blackboard)
Learning tools (e.g. Codecademy, Coursera, Udemy, Udacity)
Every repl you create is a fully functional development and production environment. "Hosting from your editor" makes it easy to iterate quickly on your work, collaborate with others, and get feedback.

We know that's a lot to take in, so we've broken down some of the key features below for developers, startups, teachers and learners. Choose your own path, or go through all of them to become an expert in all things Replit.
