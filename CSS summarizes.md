* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language designed to specify the overall appearance of webpages as well as the appearance and structure of the text and elements such as images and buttons on webpages and their layout. Styles can be specified with CSS using internal style sheet definitions which are placed right into HTML/XHTML code or in external files.

* The tutorials in this section included information on a variety of CSS topics including creating stylesheets, associating styles with specific HTML elements, setting background & text color, styling lists, setting the width & height of elements, media types, and more.

### three ways to insert CSS:
**External CSS**
**Internal CSS**
**Inline CSS**

External CSS: Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

Example : <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"> 

Internal CSS: The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.
  
Example : <style> body {background-color: linen;} </style>
  
Inline CSS: To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

Example : < h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading </h1>
